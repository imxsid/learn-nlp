# ðŸ’¥ Word Frequencies and Stop Words

## Zipf's Law

The[ **Zipf's law** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's\_law)(discovered by the linguist-statistician George Zipf) states that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to the rank of the word, where rank 1 is given to the most frequent word, 2 to the second most frequent and so on. This is also called the **power law distribution.**

****

There are three kinds of words present in any text corpus:

* Highly frequent words, called stop words, such as â€˜isâ€™, â€˜anâ€™, â€˜theâ€™, etc.
* Significant words, which are typically more important to understand the text
* Rarely occurring words, which are again less important than significant words
