### Encoding Standards

There are two most popular encoding standards:

1. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
2. Unicode
   * UTF-8
   * UTF-16

#### ASCII

The first encoding standard that came into existence was the **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) standard**, in 1960. ASCII standard assigned a unique code to each character of the keyboard which was known as  **ASCII code**.

**Unicode**

When ASCII was built, English alphabets were the only alphabets that were present on the keyboard. With time, new languages began to show up on keyboard sets which brought new characters. ASCII became outdated and couldnâ€™t incorporate so many languages. A new standard has come into existence in recent years - the **Unicode standard**. It supports all the languages in the world - both modern and the older ones.

While UTF-8 uses only 8 bits to store the character, UTF-16 (BE) uses 16 bits to store it.
